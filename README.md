# Wordle-Clone

## Wordle Clone App


This app is a clone of the popular NYT Wordle game.  

Link to project: coming soon! (I'm still working on building out a node.js backend that will deploy to Heroku)

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express

I mostly followed Ania Kubow's tutorial, and made some small changes to the code myself, namely on the backend with the creation of an Node Express Server.  The app is mainly built on two API calls on the backend, which retrieve a random five-letter word, and then check the validity of said word.

## Optimizations:

This is the first iteration, but I hope to push a second iteration soon that will align more closely with OOP principles.  E.g. it would likely be cleaner to organize each row or tile as an instantiation of a 'Row' or 'Tile' class.  Currently, the procedural programming format makes the app.js file somewhat difficult to read.  

## Lessons Learned:
From a coding perspective, the efficiency of Express is incredible (as opposed to writing plain old Node, not to disparage Node in any way);
